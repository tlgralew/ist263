<title>Tucker Gralewski - Bio</title>
</head>
<body>
My name is Tucker Gralewski, and I am currently studying advertising with and emphasis in digital. The ever-expanding world of digital excites me because of all the ways we can use it to better target and bring useful ads to specific people. I come from a very creative background so I understand what a consumer would want to see, but then I apply that to the data I find to deliver a plan that is most helpful to achieving the goal of a campaign. With that creative background, I feel comfortable using the adobe suite, along with using cameras to take beautiful photos and videos. Throughout my studies I have been highly motivated and prioritized doing well. In high school I made all-academic first teams for basketball, then in college I have made the deanâ€™s list in multiple semesters. I love spending time binge watching crime shows. I also really enjoy getting outside and will often take my dog to the beach for hours at a time.
