    <h1>Tucker Gralewski's Biography</h1>
    <p>
        My name is Tucker Gralewski, and I am currently studying advertising with and emphasis in digital at Syracuse University. The ever-expanding world of digital excites me because of all the ways we can use it to better target and bring useful ads to specific people. I come from a very <strong>creative background</strong> so I understand what a consumer would want to see, but then I apply that to the data I find to deliver a plan that is most helpful to achieving the goal of a campaign.

        With that creative background, I feel comfortable using the adobe suite, along with using cameras to take beautiful photos and videos. Throughout my studies I have been highly motivated and prioritized doing well. In high school I made all-academic first teams for basketball, then in college I have made the dean's list in multiple semesters.

    <h2>Personal Information</h2>
    <p>
        I love spending time binge watching crime shows. Being from San Diego, where it's nice year round, I also enjoy getting outside and will often take my dog to the beach for hours at a time. Going to Syracuse has been a big change of pace for me weather wise, but I love the snow! Below is a list of some other things I like to do.

        <li>Go camping with friends</li>
